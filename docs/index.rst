fca-api
===============================

A Python client library for the UK `Financial Services Register <https://register.fca.org.uk/s/>`_ `RESTful API <https://register.fca.org.uk/Developer/s/>`_.


.. note::

   The  API is free to use but accessing it, including via this library, requires
   `registration <https://register.fca.org.uk/Developer/ShAPI_LoginPage?ec=302&startURL=%2FDeveloper%2Fs%2F#>`_. Registration involves a free sign up with an email, which is used as the API username in requests, and basic personal information. Once registered an API key is available from your registration profile.

To learn more about the API please consult the `official documentation <https://register.fca.org.uk/Developer/s/>`_, or start :doc:`here <sources/low-level-api>`.
